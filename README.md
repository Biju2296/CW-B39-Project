In this project, I conducted comprehensive manual testing on an e-commerce platform, 
primarily focusing on critical functionalities such as text input and formatting across various user interfaces (UI), 
including product search, checkout, and customer feedback forms.

Test Plan & Test Case Design: I designed detailed test plans, which included specific scenarios to validate both functional and non-functional aspects of the platform. 
For example, test cases were created to verify that product search inputs handle various special characters, 
multiple spaces, and case sensitivity correctly. 
I also ensured that text formatting in product descriptions and user reviews was consistent and supported different browser environments.

Test Execution & Bug Reporting: After executing the tests, 
I documented the results meticulously, 
noting any issues related to UI, usability, or system crashes. 
Bugs were logged with clear reproduction steps in the bug tracking system to help the development team resolve them efficiently. 
A few examples of issues found included improper text alignment on mobile versions of product pages and broken HTML tags in product descriptions.

Edge Case Coverage with Decision Tables: To enhance the coverage of edge cases, 
I employed the Decision Table technique. 
This helped in analyzing the interactions between various input conditions such as different text lengths, special characters, and formatting options. 
This approach ensured that the platform could handle all possible scenarios without breaking down.

Documentation & Tracking: For test case documentation and bug tracking, 
I utilized tools such as Google Sheets and Excel. T
hese were used to keep track of test case progress, prioritize issues, and facilitate communication with stakeholders. 
In addition, shared documents helped the team stay updated on the current testing phase and resolved bugs.
